# Jate-PWA
I will build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Installation
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

npm install

## Usage
After installing npm packages, the application will be invoked by using the following command:

npm run start dev
